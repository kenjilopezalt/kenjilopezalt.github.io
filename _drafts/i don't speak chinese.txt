one of the problems of looking vaguely Chinese is that not only do Chinese people try to speak to you in Chinese, but you actually have a tough time convincing them that you <em>don't</em> speak Chinese.

Now I know what it's like to be on the receiving end of that loud, slow-talking thing English-speaking tourists do when faced with someone who doesn't speak a lick of their language.

I'm pretty sure that they do the Chinese equivalent of that dropping articles and plurals thing we tend to do. How do "where is train station?" or "me no eat spicy food" translate to Cantonese?
