title: Day 5&#58; The Best Way to Order Food in China 
---

Location: Beijing, China

After a long day of hiking on <a href="http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/2014/06/20/do-indoor-voices-exist/">the Great Wall</a>, Adri and I weren't in the mood to do anything fancy for dinner, so we took a walk down the street and employed the basic rule that has yet to fail to lead us to something delicious: if you see an alley with smoke or steam coming out of it, investigate. Our investigations led us to a smallish restaurant filled with mostly men, loudly cheering each other with glasses of the cheap Yanjing beer they serve everywhere for about 5 RMB for a half liter bottle (that's about 80Â¢), picking at plates of dumplings and noodles, along with miniature woks emitting clouds of delicious steam. They were set on top of tabletop racks filled with hot coals.

Want to know the secret to eating well and cheap in China?
