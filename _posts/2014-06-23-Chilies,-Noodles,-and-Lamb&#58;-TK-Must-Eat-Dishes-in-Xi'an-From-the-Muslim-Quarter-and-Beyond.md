## #1: Hand-stretched Noodles

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-13.jpg "Beef belt noodles")

Noodles come in all shapes and sizes 'round here, and you'll find noodles made from wheat flour, rice flour, mung bean starch, green bean starch, and a half dozen other grains and pulses in a variety of sauces and soups in the Muslim Quarter alone, but for my money, the best of the bunch are the thick, hand-stretched, ribbon-shaped type.

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-06.jpg "Rolling noodles")

The noodles are always stretched to order, and you'll recognize the restaurants that serve them by the oiled steel tables set out in front, topped with a bucket of greased dough balls. When you place an order, the noodle-stretcher will place a few balls on the oiled table and start by flattening them out with a smooth wooden dowel.

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-07.jpg "Stretching noodles")

Next, he folds and stretches the noodles as far as he can without lifting them off the table. It's actually remarkably like watching an expert pizzaiolo at work. Anyone who's made a pizza before knows the process: stretch on the work surface first, then finish the process by lifting it and letting gravity do the rest of the work.

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-08.jpg "Slapping noodles")

In this case, it's gravity along with a bit of kinetic energy provided by vigorously slapping the ever-elongating noodle up and down.

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-09.jpg "Tandem slapping")

As the noodles stretch, they get thinner and thinner. The end result is something about an inch and a half wide, with the thickness of good Italian pappardelle, though it's <em>much</em> stretchier and more supple than any Italian-style pasta.

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-11.jpg "Cooked noodles")

The noodles are boiled for a few moments along with some shredded cabbage in a large wok set over a roaring coal fire. The cook watches the pot carefully, topping it up with a bit of cold water every time the starchy liquid threatens to boil over.

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-12.jpg "Noodles in bowls")

As the noodles cook, bowls are brought out from the kitchen. At the bottom of each bowl is a bit of concentrated sauce&mdash;savory, vinegary, and aromatic.

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-14.jpg "Adri eating noodles")

Depending on what you order, the noodles are topped off with vegetables or braised meat. Beef or mutton are the most frequent choices; Don't expect to see pork here, it is the Muslim Quarter after all.

Hot chili oil is provided at the table for you to adjust the heat according to taste. The finished noodles are thick, slick, stretchy,  chewy, and <em>excellent</em> at sopping up the sauce, a mixture that fires flavor on all cylinders, with hot, sour, pungent, sweet, and meaty aromas comingling.

## #2: Stuff-on-a-Stick

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-16.jpg "Brushing lamb skewers")

You may not know it from restaurants in the West, but the Chinese are prolific consumers of things-on-sticks, whether grilled, simmered, or fried, and nowhere more so than in Xi'an, where the smoke rising from tiny chunks of lamb sizzling over coal fires competes with steam and smog as the most prevalent substance in the lower atmosphere.

You can get grilled lamb or beef skewers on almost every street in the city&mdash;Adri and I spent a night sitting on plastic stools just outside our hostel drinking beer and snacking on dime-sized chunks of lamb threaded onto skewers no thicker than piano wire and sold for one yuan apiece&mdash;but you'll get a wider selection in the Muslim quarter.

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-15.jpg "Meat skewers")

There are chunks of fatty lamb basted with chili sauce and sprinkled with cumin, dried chilies, and salt, of course, but there's also beef, mutton, lamb's liver, chicken wings, sausages of all sorts, chicken... you get the picture.

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-17.jpg "Biting in")

It helps to make your "angry Mongol" face when biting into the lamb skewers, imagining that you're sitting around a 12th Century fire, planning your next strategic move in world-conquest-by-horseback.

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-18.jpg "Quail eggs on skewers")

One of my favorite skewers was these: quail eggs fried in a cute little cast iron aebelskiver pan. What makes these different from the ones <a href="TK">I so disparaged at the Beijing street food market?</a>

Easy. The answer is this:

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-19.jpg "Quail eggs brushed in sauce")

A big fat swipe of sauce, in the Sichuan <em>mala</em>-style, flavored with both dried hot chilies and mouth-numbing citrus-y Sichuan peppercorns.

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-20.jpg "Vegetable skewers")

Don't worry, even vegetarians can get their things-on-a-stick fix. In fact, the whole Muslim Quarter and the city of Xi'an in general is a haven for vegetarians in a country where meat is a symbol of prosperity.

So what happens to all those wooden skewers once they've been picked clean?

You see this every 20 meters or so:

## #3: Persimmon Doughnuts

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-22.jpg "Persimmon doughnuts")

Like many Asian desserts, these persimmon doughnuts can pose a bit of a textural challenge for Westerners. They're fried and crisp, sure, but the interiors are made of an entirely unleavened dough based on dried persimmons with a dense, chewy texture much like Japanese <em>mochi</em>.

Persimmon doughnut vendors will have a dozen or so varieties, each with a different filling in the center, though it beats me what they all are. I employed the usual tactic I fall back on when faced with a food choice in a language I don't understand: I pointed at the one the guy in front of me pointed at. It ended up being what I believe was some sort of slightly sour, candied citrus rind.

## #4: Hammered Candy

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-23.jpg "stretching candy")

You know how come summer time, every high school kid in New England gets a job as a clam-fryer or lobster roll-stuffer or root beer-slinger at some seaside shack?

I think sugar-stretcher and candy-hammerer is the Xi'an equivalent of those jobs.

Xi'an is a city obsessed with nuts, and their candy reflects it. After repeatedly folding and stretching hot sugar across a hook (it comes dangerously close to touching the spit-covered street every time it stretches out, but I never once saw one of thee kids fail in his mission), the candy gets transferred to a large wooden stump, where it's sprinkled with nuts.

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-24.jpg "Pounding candy")

That's when the kids-with-hammers get a go at it, pounding the nuts into the warm candy until it hardens into a quarter-inch-thick sheet.

Wanna know the honest truth? I didn't <em>actually</em> taste the stuff&mdash;candy just ain't my thing&mdash;so I'm not sure what it's doing on a "must eat" list. That said, it's pretty cool to watch anyway.

## #5: Braised Sheep's Hooves

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-25.jpg "Sheep hooves")

I believe that it's in Disney World where there's a string of kiosks called "Shank O' the Day" where Hoveround-bound park-goers can chow down on entire lamb shanks as they wait in line for the spinning tea cups.

I don't know why I mention it other than that it's what came to mind when I saw the piles and piles of braised sheep's feet you find on the main stretch of the Muslim Quarter, some naked, some dressed in chilies and sesame. They're gelatinous and <em>strong</em>, so you better be sure what you're getting yourself into before you pick one up.

## #6: Chinese Corned Beef Sandwiches

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-28.jpg "Beef bing")

<a href="TK">Bing</a>, the arepa-like steam-griddled bread split and stuffed with a wide variety of fillings (or as they call them in the Xi'an dialect <em>TK</em>), are a staple around here. A local downing a bowl of liangpi noodles with chopsticks in one hand and a small pork-filled bing in the other is a sight you come across multiple times a day.

In the Muslim quarter, however, you'll also see lines for bing stuffed with beef which in all honesty, tastes like a moister, more-chopped version of corned beef.

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-26.jpg "Spreading chili sauce")

The cook will fish out chunks of braised cured beef brisket from a vat in their kiosk and place it on a wooden chopping block before finely chopping it with a large cleaver. He then splits open a bing and spreads it with chick chili oil.

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-27.jpg "Chopped meat")

Finally, it's stuffed with some of the chopped beef.

Wash it all down with a glass of prune juice, which is sold out of bubblers all over the place.

## #7: Fried Potatoes

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-31.jpg "Potatoes in bowl")

Holy crap, fried spiced Xi'anese potatoes, where the heck have you been all my life, and please let us never part again, mmkay?

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-29.jpg "Fried potatoes")

They start as teeny-tiny yellow potatoes deep fried in a large, shallow vat. At this point, they very much resemble Colombian <em>papas criollas</em>, a variety of Andean potato that my Colombian wife, Adri, is particularly fond of. In Colombia, they deep fry them in a similar manner, until lightly crisp on the outside, then toss them with salt and serve them with <a href="TK">Colombian salsa</a>.

In Xi'an, they take those same fried potatoes (ok, the Chinese potatoes are a little creamier and less fluffy than their Colombian counterparts) and toss them to order in a wok with a couple types of dried chili, finely ground and coarsely-smashed cumin, salt, sugar, garlic, and scallions.

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-30.jpg "Spicing the potatoes")

The spiced potatoes are served in paper bowls with a bamboo skewer for eating on the go. These wil be making an appearance in my apartment come September.

## #8: Mutton Dumplings

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-32.jpg "Dumplings")

So they aren't the most delicate-skinned, expertly-made dumplings in all of China, but the dumplings in the muslim quarter are unique in that they forgo the standard pork filling for beef or&mdash;better yet&mbath;chopped mutton. Heavily spiced and not-too juicy, the purse-shaped steamed dumplings are served with a dish of black vinegar slicked with roasted chili oil.

P.S. the word for lamb is <em>yang rou</em> (beef is <em>niu rou</em>). Learn it well, as it'll serve you at times like this.

## #9: Bread and Mutton Soup

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-34.jpg "Bread soup")

If you wander deep enough into the side streets of the Muslim Quarter, you'll run into a stretch of restaurants where the folks sitting at the table outside are all meticulously tearing flat disks of pita bread into tiny cubes into big soup bowls in front of them.

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-33.jpg "Breaking bread")

You've just walked by a <em>TK</em> restaurant, which specializes in what is the most-interesting-conceptually but least-interesting-actually dish in the Muslim Quarter. Once you've filled up your bowl with torn bread, it then gets whisked back to the kitchen where they'll add a handful of thin rice noodles, some chopped greens, and a few slices of braised mutton or beef to the bowl before topping it up with a thick, mildly-flavored broth.

If it weren't for the pickled garlic and sweet chili paste served on the side, there's be little to say about this flavor-wise. As it is, it's the kind of dish you eat when you want to be comforted and stuffed.

## #9 Fried Bean Jelly Cubes

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-muslim-quarter-35.jpg "Fried green bean jelly")

<em>What <strong>are</strong> those things</em>, Adri and I kept asking as we walked past large shallow pans filled with cubes of some sort of vegetable coated in a dark red sauce studded with chilies and scallions. <em>Turnips? Potatoes?</em>

Turns out those cubes were actually <em>liangfen</em>, a tofu-like jelly made with fresh green bean starch. It also happens to be one of my favorite foods.

To be frank, I've only ever had it served cold, usually dressed with a fiery chili sauce, Sichuan style. This hot incarnation was a bit of a minor revelation. The cubes hold heat&mdash;both the kind measured in degrees and Scoville units&mdash;remarkably well, and actually manage to get nice and crispy around the edges.

Like the potatoes, this stuff is served in small paper bowls made for snacking as you walk.

## #10: Liangpi Noodles

![alt-text-here](http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/images/20140623-xian-food/20140623-xian-food-other-1.jpg "Liangpi")

The true staple of the city, liangpi noodles are made by first washing a wheat or rice flour dough in water until its starches are completely rinsed off. This starchy water is then allowed to sit overnight until the starches collect at the bottom. The clear water above is poured off, and the ultra-starchy liquid below is steamed until it forms thin sheets with a uniquely crunchy-but-soft texture.

Those sheets are cut by hand into thin ribbons, then tossed with cucumber shreds and bean sprouts in a sauce made with sesame paste, black vinegar, and roasted chili oil. It all gets served, inevitably, out of bowls that are first slipped into a thin plastic bag for easy clean-up. You wouldn't believe how many plastic bags the city goes through in the name of deliciousness and hygiene.

Good news, New Yorkers: the versions of this dish (and the various pulled-noodle dishes) that they serve at Xi'an Famous Foods in New York is actually every bit as good as anything I had in Xi'an.
