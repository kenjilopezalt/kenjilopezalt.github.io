Wanna know how great Adri is? She's the kind of wife who is sporting enough to endure a <a href="">nerve-wracking, immune-system-testing, 16-hour train ride</a> all so that her loving but often demanding and occasionally insane husband could taste a single dish of food at a single restaurant. It's a food (and in fact an entire cuisine) that she doesn't even <em>like</em>. Isn't that sweet?

Ok, to be fair, there were actually a few dishes I wanted to taste beyond <em>mapo doufu</em>, the Sichuan classic of silken tofu glazed with a slick of crimson-red chili oil and a dusting of toasted Sichuan peppercorns, but we managed to track down nearly every one of them.

Though Chongqing Province and the city of Chongqing itself are no longer part of Sichuan Province (they split in the 90s), they share a culinary and cultural backbone. It's a foundation built on the slow, smoldering burn of dried chilies, the pungent bite of raw garlic, and mouth-numbing handfuls of citrus-scented Sichuan peppercorns, all balanced with dashes of black vinegar and more peanuts than you ever thought you could eat.

As it so happens, chilies, sichuan peppers, garlic, vinegar, and peanuts are five of my favorite things.

The spitting issue that seems to plague parts of urban China is thankfully almost absent from Chengdu, which is fortunate: If Chengduers behaved a bit more like Beijngers, then the streets of Chengdu would literally run red with rivers of chili oil. At least outside the <em>huoguo</em> (hot pot) restaurants that seem to occupy every other door front.

I'm a little ashamed to admit that Adri and I did not actually try and hot pot while we were in Chengdu or Chongqing (the birthplace of the dish), though <del>we</del> I <em>did</em> stare creepily through a restaurant window, quietly muttering "liquid hot mag-ma" as a group of friends dipped various meats and vegetables into a wide vat of  broth. Its surface, scattered with whole star anise and Sichuan peppercorns, bubbled furiously through a half-inch-thick layer of dark red chili oil.

If we had a half dozen friends who would sit around and dip-meat with us, we no doubt would have had a grand time. But hot pot just doesn't seem right with two people, as the social aspect of it is at least as important as the flavor, right? Besides, we were on a tight timeframe that the crippling bouts of heartburn, indigestion, and chili-induced migraines weren't helping, and I had more than a few things to taste.

I'm going to be totally unabashedly biased here and list them in order of my favorite to least favorite, though let's make one thing clear: I wouldn't kick any of these out of bed, much less my dinner table.

##1. Mapo Doufu

This is it. My favorite dish in the world and the grandmother of Sichuan cuisine. Translated literally as "pock-marked grandmother's tofu," its totally apocryphal origin story is identical to a half dozen other food origin stories: it starts with hungry crowds and a cook with few ingredients but plenty of creativity.

TK STORY

I very rarely get visibly excited about anything&mdash;I'm not sure if that makes me a stoic, or an emotionless shell of a human being&mdash;but as we sat down at Chen Mapo Doufu, the upscale restaurant that was supposedly built on the fame and recipe of Grandma Chen herself, I got a little giddy.

You can find Mapo Doufu on the menu at almost any restaurant in China, especially in Sichuan, but this version, served in a screaming-hot cast iron bowl was easily the best. Tender cubes of silken tofu laced with tender ground beef under a bubbling layer of chili oil, fragrant with toasted Sichuan peppercorn and fermented horse beans. It doesn't have the blast of chili-heat you might expect from looking at it. Rather, it has a more subtle, layered heat with chilies that come through alternately as sweet and hot with the rich, almost raisin-like flavor of dried fruit.

I'm happy to say that the best version I've had in the states, made by a Sichuan chef at <a href="TK">Fuloon, in Malden, MA</a> is a near perfect taste-alike to the one at Chen. I'm even happier to report that the chef was <a href="TK">kind enough to share his techniques and recipe with me</a> a few years back. I even spent the time developing those techniques into a <a href="TK">full-fledged vegetarian version</a> that I like even <em>better</em> than the meaty one. Let's spread the Mapo love around, ok?

##2. Fuqi Feipian (Sliced Beef Tripe in Chili Oil With Peanuts)

Whenever a Sichuan menu is placed in front of me, my eyes instinctively gravitate towards the cold appetizers, many of which come doused in a vinaigrette-like sauce made with roasted chili oil, Sichuan peppercorns, garlic, sesame seeds, sugar, and fruity Chinkiang black vinegar.

<em>Fuqi Feipian</em> TK story. Most versions don't use actual lungs in the recipe. Instead, you can expect shavings of braised and chilled oxtail along with thin slices of tendon and tripe, paper-thin and crunchy in texture. The slices are tossed with that chili vinaigrette and served with roasted peanuts and chopped cilantro.

If you generally avoid offal, this might be a good way to introduce yourself to it&mdash;the meat is really all about texture, its flavor almost completely dominated by the in-your-face sauce it comes soaked in.

I still haven't recovered completely from eating in Sichuan and Chongqing. I wake up in the middle of the night with crippling bouts of heartburn. My guts have been torn to shreds by chilies&mdash;I've exercised China's bring-your-own-toilet-paper policy in more places than I care to admit. When I sweat, my pores ooze out pure capsaicin. Adri long ago shifted to a basic subsistence diet of plain crackers, dried fruit, and milk tea.

I can't wait to get home to I can cook some of this stuff in my own kitchen. Self-inflicted pain is always the best kind.
