It's 5AM and I'm woken up by an earsplitting, crackling hiss, followed by  pre-recorded message that sounds like an angry monk reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogon">Vogon</a> poetry over a New York subway PA system. It's not the first thing you want to hear in the morning, but it's a good deal better than what follows: a two minute excerpt of Kenny G's interpretation of The Girl From Ipanema.

I'm fairly certain that the best and brightest minds in China have been hard at work coming up with a series of sounds scientifically proven to be the most efficient way to deprive innocent ship passengers of sleep. If hell had a waiting room, this would be the soundtrack.

This, by the way, is the same noise I awoke to yesterday morning at 5AM. It was on a repeated loop that played continuously until 7, when it finally gave way to China's normal soundtrack: loogie hocking, coughing, and the dramatically-loud pitter patter of unrestrained children. I'm fairly certain it's going to happen again today.

Waking up at 5AM wouldn't be so bad if it happened to be after a good night's sleep in a comfortable bed to the smell of a hot breakfast being prepared. Instead, everything is damp. And I mean <em>everything</em>. The bed is damp. The sheets are damp and moldy-smelling. The pillows are damp. My hair is damp (and I don't even <em>have</em> hair right now). The carpet, coated in decades of grime and spit, are damp. The dried spicy shredded squid I bought as a snack packed in a sealed plastic pouch with a packet of silicone desiccant is damp. Even the ultra-fast-drying synthetic fiber clothes, which we were assured would have to break the basic laws of thermodynamics in order to get damp, are damp.

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard the pride of the yangtzi. Please disregard all posted signs, especially the ones that says "no spitting anywhere," and "no smoking."

I'm not normally a "cruise" kind of guy. I've taken one cruise in my life, but after <a href="http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/2014/06/17/Beijing-bound/">a hectic week in Beijing</a>, followed by some <a href="http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/2014/06/27/Kenji-and-Adri-on-Emai-Shan/">heavy hiking on Emai Shan</a> (complete with asshole monkeys), and a few more hectic days <a href="http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/2014/06/30/Essential-Sichuan-Eats-Beyond-Hot-Pot/">in Sichuan and Chongqing</a>, a slow, lazy, romantic cruise on the Yangzi river, surrounded by the famous Three Gorges sounded pretty heavenly, and we decided to go full-immersion by skipping the International cruise lines and opting for an operator who catered to Chinese tourists. Apart from a sweet young Swiss girl traveling alone, we were the only non-Chinese tourist on the trip.


As we were herded aboard our ship via a long concrete staircase (the funicular next to the stairs looked like it hadn't moved up or down its rusted tracks for decades), the first thing we noticed was the smell. Water-bound vessels always have some kind of pungent aroma. That comes with the territory. But this was something different.
