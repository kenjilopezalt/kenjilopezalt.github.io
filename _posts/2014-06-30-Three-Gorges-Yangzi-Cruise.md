It's 5AM and I'm woken up by an earsplitting, crackling hiss, followed by  pre-recorded message that sounds like an angry monk reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogon">Vogon</a> poetry over a New York subway PA system. It's not the first thing you want to hear in the morning, but it's a good deal better than what follows: a two minute excerpt of Kenny G's interpretation of The Girl From Ipanema.

If hell had a waiting room, this would be the soundtrack.

This, by the way, is the same noise I awoke to yesterday morning at 5AM, and yesterday, it was on a repeated loop that played continuously from 5 to 7AM. I'm fairly certain it's going to happen again today.

Waking up at 5AM wouldn't be so bad if it happened to be after a good night's sleep in a comfortable bed to the smell of a hot breakfast being prepared. Instead, everything is damp. And I mean <em>everything</em>. The bed is damp. The sheets are damp and moldy-smelling. The pillows are damp. My hair is damp (and I don't even <em>have</em> hair right now). The carpet, coated in decades of grime and spit, are damp. The dried spicy shredded squid I bought as a snack packed in a sealed plastic pouch with a packet of silicone desiccant is damp. Even the ultra-fast-drying synthetic fiber clothes, which we were assured would have to break the basic laws of thermodynamics in order to get damp, are damp.

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard
