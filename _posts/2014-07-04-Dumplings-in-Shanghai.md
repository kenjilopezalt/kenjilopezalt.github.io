This is the meal I've been waiting for&mdash;the main reason I felt compelled to make my wife re-visit Shanghai, in fact. Ever since having my first taste of a Xiao Long Bao&mdash;variously referred to as "soup dumplings" or "juicy steamed buns" on American Chinese menus&mdash;I've yearned to taste them at the source in Shanghai.

Why the love? Well, if you've yet to experience XLB (as those cool kids in the know like to refer to them in Tweets), they're made by gently folding a gelatin-rich filling into a thin round of stretchy wheat dough. The dough gets gathered up and pleated into a cute little swirled bun with a tiny nipple at the top. As the dumpling gets subsequently steamed, the gelatin-rich broth in the filling melts out, filling up the delicately steamed wrapper with savory soup, the meat forming a tender, springy ball inside. To eat them you pick them up with chopsticks, dip them gingerly into sauce,* then proceed by either nibbling off a corner of dough and sucking out the soup, or by downing the whole thing in one go, letting it burst in your mouth like a savory Chinese Gusher.

<small>*Don't you just love a good Tom Swiftie?</small>

But in Shanghai, XLB are only half of the soup dumping story. Sheng Jian Bao&mdash;<em>fried</em> soup dumplings&mdash;while a ubiquitous breakfast food or snack in Shanghai for at least the last century, live in the shadow of their far more famous steamed counterpart. This is unfortunate, because if anything. SJB are even tastier than XLB&mdash;at least when made right. They start with a slightly thicker dough that, just like XLB, get pleated around a gelatin-rich filling. They're subsequently cooked in large, covered cast iron pans filled with just enough water to steam them through. As the water evaporates, the dumplings begin to fry on their bottom surface. You end up with a tender, steamed, juice-filled bun with a golden-brown, crisply fried bottom.

The problem is that in the US, it's much more difficult to find good SJB than good XLB. Poor SJB are doughy, tough, and lacking in juice. Even good ones, like the <a href="http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2011/07/shanghai-cafe-deluxe-chinatown-nyc-chinese-restaurant-review-slideshow.html#show-170559">Fried tiny Buns with Pork at Shanghai Cafe Deluxe</a> (who also happen to serve <a href="http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2011/12/where-to-get-the-best-soup-dumplings-in-chinatown-nyc-new-york-xiao-long-bao.html">the best soup dumplings in Manhattan's Chinatown</a>) are hit and miss&mdash;sometimes they're tender and juicy, other times they're doughy and dry inside.

Just like XLB, they have an extremely short half life. If you aren't getting them fresh from the steamer, then you may as well not get them at all.

Fortunately, there's one street in Shanghai where you can taste <em>both</em> of these local specialties, their doorways just meters apart.

##Jia Jia Xiao Long Bao

Jia Jia Xiao Long Bao, located at number 90 on Huanghe Road (an easy walk from People's Park) is a Shanghai institution, serving what many claim are the best soup dumplings in the city. We went on the advice of Ken Phang, Serious Eater and long-time Shanghai resident to check it out.

The place is all business, with a short line out the door, a short menu printed on the wall, and a cashier who takes orders and money before you get seated. You'd better know what you want before you sit down, because after you're seated, you'll have to eat, get up, wait on line again, and re-order if you want more.

I've noticed that many buildings in China have the same pattern of vertically-oriented, non-staggered, shiny white tiles on their facades that makes strolling down the street feel like you're walking inside a very large men's locker room.* Jia Jia has those same tiles on the inside as well, which makes you feel like you're <em>eating</em> inside a men's locker room. Which is to say, people are here for the food and the food only.

<small>*this may be inducing some sort of Pavlovian response in little children, which would explain why they feel the need to pee on the streets.</small>

After briefly consulting our Chinese-English dictionary app on my phone, we successfully place an order for a dozen pork dumplings, a dozen pork and crab dumplings, some sweet ginger sauce, and a bowl of what I believe is egg and seaweed soup.

As you walk past the register, you see a mini factory line of a half dozen people making dumplings.

Two people stand at one end of the table, tearing dough into small balls and passing them on to the next two folks, who roll out the soft, white dough into thin wrappers.

The wrappers are passed to the final set of hands, who use a thin pastry brush to dollop some raw filling into the center of the dough before crimping it up into a tiny purse.
