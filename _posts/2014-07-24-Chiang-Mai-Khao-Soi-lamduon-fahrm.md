title: Chiang Mai&#58; Stellar Khao Soi at Lamduon Fahrm Kaosoi
---

It may have just been that it was our first stop after the nerve-wracking hustle and bustle that is China, but Chiang Mai easily makes the list of my top five cities in the world. Everything about it, from the soft-spoken Thai people to the ex-pats to the iced beers to the delicious meals on every corner says <em>relax. There's no need to rush here. You're in good hands.</em>

Even by the generally relaxed and groovy Thai standards, Chiang Mai is especially relaxed and groovy. Heck, even the tuk-tuk drivers smile at you if you call them out for trying to overcharge you for a quick ride.

Culinarily, it's also one of the least familiar regions of Thailand. Sure, you can find the pad thai, some of the central curries, and the som tom that is served <em>everywhere</em>, but the local dishes, influenced by Burma to the Northwest, and China's Yunnan province and Laos to the north, don't really make it far beyond Northern Thai borders.

We're talking laap salads made with toasted spices and pork blood. Grilled offal served with chili sauce. Soups with deep, bitter flavors and pounded salads flavored with roasted dried fish. You've all heard about the whole "hot, sour, salty, bitter, sweet" thing that a good Thai dish is supposed to have going for it, right? Northern Thai food bucks all that&mdash;you'll find individual dishes that are intensely bitter or intensely sour or intensely hot, with no real balance, until you have them all on the table together, a bite of this and a bite of that, all scooped up with sticky rice.

It's been a couple weeks since Adri and I left Chiang Mai and I can't wait to go back.
