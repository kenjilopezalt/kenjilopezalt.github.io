title: Nong Khai&#58; Can't-Miss Issan Salads at DD Restaurant
---

Nong Khai, a small town in Northeastern Thailand on the banks of the Mekong river just across the border from Laos is not on the top of most tourstss must-visit lists. Being a border town, it gets a fair share of backpacker traffic, mostly just from folks passing through to Vientiane on the Lao side.

Those folks are making a mistake.

Some people <em>do</em> stop in town for a night or two, and most of them end up hitting the mosquito-addled river-side restaurants that serve up mediocre Issan and Vietnamese food.

Those folks are also making a mistake.

Here's what they <em>should</em> be doing: walking just a few meters away from the river to the center of town, right at the intersection of Prajak Sillapakhom Alley and Janjobtit Road and grabbing one of the plastic seats at DD Restaurant.

You can't miss it. It's the place that's packed with locals day and night. Over the course of our two-night stay in Nong Khai, we ended up eating there four times, and it was this that first got us hooked:
