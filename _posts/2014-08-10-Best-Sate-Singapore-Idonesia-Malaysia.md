Adri and I <a href="http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/2014/06/17/Beijing-bound/">made a pact on the very first day we got to Asia over two months ago</a>, and it was this: <strong>If we see smoke or steam coming out of a dark alleyway, we will investigate</strong>.

This one simple rule has served us well, delivering us to everything from <a href="http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/2014/06/18/SO-MANY-DUMPLINGS/">steamed buns</A> to <a href="http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/2014/06/19/The-Forbidden-City-and-Good-God-are-Jian-Bing-Awesome/>jian bing</a> to <a href="http://kenjilopezalt.github.io/2014/06/21/The-Secret-to-Good-Cheap-Eating/">noodles and dumplings</a>, but nowhere has it been as useful as it's been in the Singapore-Indonesia-Malayasia triangle, where sate delivers its smoke signals from nearly every alleyway you walk by.

We all know what it is, right? Little chunks of marinated meat threaded onto bamboo skewers, grilled over coals until charred, then served with a sweet-and-spicy peanut-based dipping sauce? Heck, even Chipotle's <a href="http://shophousekitchen.com/">Asian-themed chain Shophouse Kitchen</a> has a version on the menu

As it turns out, that basic description is really only the tiny tip of a vast iceberg of regional variations in both preparation and sauce. You'll find goat satay that's been braised before grilling in Sumatra, or bright yellow satay made with chicken skin in Melaka. You'll get minced meat satay grilled on lemongrass in Bali or 

I've had a tough time locating definitive sources on the exact history of sate, but most seem to agree that it was brought to SouthEast Asia by arab traders in the 15th century, and that it shares its origins with kebab and shawarma, which in turn are related to all of the skewered meats in China and India, and indeed the entire diaspora of meat-on-a-stick from the Middle East.

The variety of sate (spelled "satay" in Singapore and parts of Malaysia)

##Satay in Singapore


We were severely chastised by K.F. Seetoh, Singaporean food guru and the man behind <a href="http://www.makansutra.com/">Makansutra</a>, the go-to guide for Singapore eats, when I told him that we had been to Lau Pa Sat, a food center located in Singapore's central business district.

"Lau Pa Sat? Huh. That's a place for <em>people like you</em>," he said, gesturing towards us, decked out in our cameras and tourist gear.

Fair enough. It <em>was</em> pretty packed with tourists. But you know what? That doesn't change the fact that some of the most delicious bites we had during our week-long stay in Singapore came from there. I'd brave the tourists for good satay, barbecued skate, and black pepper crab any day.

The primary reason to visit Lau Pa Sat is for the satay stalls, which set up in the street in front of the main market. As you walk down the street, you'll be accosted by hawkers offering to set you in front of their own stalls, handing you menus to order from.

<strong>Pro-tip:</strong> <em>the hawker's don't own the tables in front of their stalls.</em> As a visitor to the market, you are allowed to sit wherever you'd like and order food from any stall you like. If a hawker insists you order from him for sitting near his stall, politely decline, place your packet of tissues down on the table to reserve your place, walk around, and order from whoever you damn well please.

For the record, there's a good chance you'll see a long line for stall number 7/8
